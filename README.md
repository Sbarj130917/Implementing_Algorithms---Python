# Algorithms - Python
Implemented  some  comparison-based  sorting  algorithms  and  observed  their  performance  for  different  size.  
Implement  the  following  sorting  algorithms.  
1.Insertion  sort  
2.Merge  sort  
3.In-place  quicksort
4.Modified  quicksort  
  a.Used  median-of-three  as  pivot.
  b.For  small  subproblem  size  (), used  insertion  sort.

Execution:
1.Ran  these  algorithms  for  different  input  sizes  (e.g.    =  500,  1000,  2000,  4000,  5000,  10000,  20000,  30000,  40000  and  50,000) to compare  these  sorting  algorithms.  Randomly  generated  numbers  for  input  array.  Recorded  the  execution  time and plotted  them  all  in  a  single  graph  against  input  size. 
2.In  addition,  observed  and  presented  performance  of  the  following  two  special  cases:  
  a.Input  array  is  already  sorted.  
  b.Input  array  is  inversely  sorted.
